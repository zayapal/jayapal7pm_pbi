Power BI Support Responsibilities in One Project
=========================================================================================
a) They work in one support tool( Servicenow, Assure Service Desk), where they find production issues (live system / report issues)
b) The issues are entered by the customer team in to  the tool 
c) The issues may be incidents (one time occured) or problem tickets (frequently occured issue raised as problem for detailed diagnosis)     or performance issues

  Ex: Incidents

	a) Report data invalid
	b) Report is not showing Mum data
	c) The total of the value seems wrong
	
	d) Connection issues [ report is not able to connect to cube]
	
    Problem Tickets

	a) Repeatedly the report showing wrong data value "Jisper"
	b) Repeatedly report disconnecting in middle

  Performance issues

	a) Power BI Report running longer time
	b) Report halted and not showing any data
	c) Report occupying more memory
	d) Report using many system resources

d) There are multiple production levels [L1 (high), L2, L3, L4 (low)], and the severity  in each level is P1(high: 2-4 hrs), p2 (8-10 hrs), P3, P4 (low)
	L1 incidents: P1,P2,P3,P4
	L2 Incidents: P1,P2,P3,P4
	L3 Incidents: P1,P2,P3,P4
	L4 Incidents: P1,P2,P3,P4

 
 Resolution:

a) Verify at report level the issue or going to Audit or Log files, monitor the issue area
b) Implement the change at near production (UAT / Integration etc.), test it, peer review it and go for approvals
c) Implement the change at production.
